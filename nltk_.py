def string_edit_distance(s1, s2):
    """
    Calculate the Levenshtein edit-distance between two strings.
    The edit distance is the number of characters that need to be
    substituted, inserted, or deleted, to transform s1 into s2.  For
    example, transforming "rain" to "shine" requires three steps,
    consisting of two substitutions and one insertion:
    "rain" -> "sain" -> "shin" -> "shine".  These operations could have
    been done in other orders, but at least three steps are needed.
